# BoundaryCrossingOSPP

The file BoundaryCrossingOSPPBoundaryPackage contains all the function and is linked to the files BoundaryCrossingOSPPSimulationStudy and OSPPBoundaryCrossingNumericalIllustrations that are the computable files.

I highly recommend to delete all the output when starting to use the computable file otherwise you may face running time difficulties because of the dynamic calculation.

Dynamic calculation needs to be on so the values can be displayed and the parameters changed.
